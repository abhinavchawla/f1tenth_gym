idea: rather than just explore branches in code, explore branches in SPACE

Use observation function on simulator state to prduce state -> branch. can be as white box as you want

first idea -> state is 1-d variable: track position... distance around waypoints
branch is -> opponent on left, opponent on right, opponent in front, opponent behind

test scenario for 1 seconds -> opponent faster, opponent same, opponent slower

so it's like a tree to explore, with some faults being detected,

algorithm:
run full scenario, at each point put state into history_set

todo: reject function -> if opponent crashes

pick unexplored random node to mutate, mutate and run until approximate repeat found in history_set
 -> need to define a function -> observation(cur) \exists history
 -> simple idea, if exists same observation at close position in space in front of current position
